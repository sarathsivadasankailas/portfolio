                            The year 2022 was a special year for me. I did my dream travel on 2022 with my family to Europe.
                            Me and my wife along with our parents covered around 7 countries in Europe. We started our trip on
                            May 11th. We took our flight from Kochi to Paris. From France, we travelled through Belgium, Amsterdam,
                            Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Rome. It was a 9 day trip and on May 20th we returned from Milan, Italy to Kochi.
